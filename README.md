# Authentication Token Obtain and Replace (ATOR)

ATOR is a Burp Suite extension that obtains tokens from a recorded macro and replaces them in later requests. It covers access and refresh tokens in headers, cookies, the URL, and XML, JSON, or form bodies.

For setup, workflows, and the Burp MCP tool and command reference, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

Version 2.5 adds an activity log and a Repeater label regex to the Montoya HTTP path and domain controls introduced in 2.4.2.

The original idea comes from [ExtendedMacro](https://github.com/FrUh/ExtendedMacro).

## What 2.5 changes

The **Activity** tab shows the latest 500 ATOR decisions: time, hook, Burp tool, HTTP method, host, outcome, and reason. It records when requests are updated or skipped, when a response triggers a refresh, and when a session rule runs. It stays in memory and can be cleared from the tab. It does not store bodies, token values, header values, or paths.

Settings guidance wraps as plain text in Burp, so domain and Repeater instructions stay readable with themes that display HTML labels literally.

To limit ATOR to selected Repeater requests, open **Settings → Repeater labels**, enter a Java regex such as `dhanesh`, and click **Save regex**. In each Repeater request that should use ATOR, add a header such as:

```http
X-ATOR-Repeater-Tab: validation-dhanesh-for-123
```

ATOR removes that header before the request is sent. The regex uses a substring match, so `dhanesh` matches the example label. With a regex set, Repeater requests with a missing or nonmatching label are passed through without token replacement or error-triggered retry. Clear the regex to restore the previous behavior for all Repeater requests. The Repeater tool checkbox must still be enabled. The regex is saved in Burp preferences and included in ATOR export and import; older exports leave it unchanged. The `status` command includes `repeaterLabelRegex` and `repeaterLabelHeader`.

Burp's [Montoya API does not expose existing Repeater tab titles](https://github.com/PortSwigger/burp-extensions-montoya-api/issues/139), so ATOR cannot automatically use a tab's visible name. Add or change the label in the request editor when you rename a tab. The `ATOR` session handling action also cannot see its source tool; while a Repeater label regex is set, it requires a matching label for any session-rule invocation. The live HTTP handler continues to handle other enabled tools normally.

## What 2.4.2 changes

- **Settings → Domains.** Type a host and press Add. `*.example.com` includes that domain and its subdomains. `host:port` pins a port. **Only selected domains** turns the filter on. Clear the list to handle every host again.
- **Send to ATOR → 3. Add domain.** The host of each selected message is added and the filter turns on.
- `X-ATOR-Command: domains` replaces the list. The body is a JSON array, `{"domains":["api.example.com","*.lab.local"]}`, or one host per line. `{"domains":[]}` handles every host again. `{"enabled":false}` keeps the list and handles every host.
- Export and import include `domains` and `domainsEnabled`. An older export file without those keys leaves the current list as it is.

The filter applies to the HTTP handler and to the `ATOR` session handling action. Command requests are answered before the filter. Macro requests stay marked with `X-ATOR-Macro` and are not filtered again. The list is saved in Burp's extension preferences and comes back after a reload.

## What 2.4.1 changes

Earlier builds rewrote the raw request bytes from a legacy HTTP listener. On Burp 2026.8 that rewrite dropped HTTP/2 framing, so a replaced request left the tool.

2.4.1 registers two Montoya hooks instead:

| Hook | Class | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP handler | `AtorHttpHandler` | Applies stored tokens on the way out. On an error response, refreshes the token and retries. |
| Session handling action | `AtorSessionAction` | Action name `ATOR`. Session rules, including rules written by burp-mcp `set_project_options`, call it before the request is sent. |

Message edits go through Montoya `withPath`, `withUpdatedHeader`, and `withBody`. HTTP/2 messages stay structured. HTTP/1 messages can still fall back to a raw text replace when the structured edit does not match the bytes the preview shows.

Other behavior in this build:

- Header matching is case-insensitive. HTTP/2 sends lowercase header names.
- `Content-Length` is updated from the body bytes, and a missing length is added when the body is not empty.
- JWT extraction names that start with `jwt` still split on `_` and read a claim. Padding is added before the Base64-url decode, and a missing claim returns the original token.
- Obtain and refresh share one lock (60 second wait) so two tools do not run the login macro at the same time. Macro requests carry `X-ATOR-Macro: 1` and are not processed again.
- Preview mode turns the live handler and the session action off. Use Preview to inspect a replacement before it rewrites traffic.
- The Settings tab adds **Extensions (burp-mcp)** and **Burp AI**. Both default to on, with Repeater, Intruder, Scanner, Sequencer, and Proxy. **InScope** defaults to off. The Spider checkbox is still on the tab and is not read by the Montoya handler.

The extension logs this line when both the legacy and Montoya entry points have run:

```text
ATOR v2.5.2 loaded for Burp 2026.8 (Montoya HTTP handler, HTTP/2 safe).
```

## How a request is handled

1. If any extraction value is missing, or is an extraction sentinel (`Ext ERR on SPOT`, `ExtERRonSPOT`, `EXTRACTION_ERROR`), ATOR runs the obtain macro.
2. Each replacement rule locates the current token (URL, JSON or multipart body, or header) and writes the stored value into that section.
3. When the response matches the configured error condition, ATOR runs the obtain macro again, rebuilds the original request, sends it, and returns that response to the tool. The message note is `ATOR refreshed this response`.

The handler skips the request when Preview is on, the tool checkbox is off, **InScope** is on and the request is out of scope, **Only selected domains** is on and the host is not in the domain list, or a configured Repeater label regex does not match. A handler exception is logged; ATOR passes the request through after removing its label header.

The session action only does steps 1 and 2. The error-triggered retry stays on the HTTP handler.

## burp-mcp commands

burp-mcp has no separate ATOR invoke API. Send a normal request with `send_http1_request` or `send_http2_request` and add the header `X-ATOR-Command`. The handler accepts that header only from **Extensions**, **Burp AI**, and **Repeater**, so a proxied browser cannot call it. The request is not forwarded.

| Command | Body | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | empty | JSON snapshot. Extraction names and presence are included; values are withheld. |
| `refresh` | empty | Runs the obtain macro, then the same snapshot as `status`. |
| `export` | empty | `{ "ok": true, "action": "export", "config": "<ATOR export JSON>" }`. `config` is the same document the Settings **Export ATOR** button writes. |
| `import` | ATOR export JSON | Loads error conditions, obtain steps, and replacement rules on the Swing thread. The response is a `status` snapshot without extraction values. A `domains` array in the document replaces the domain list. |
| `domains` | JSON array, `{"domains":[...]}`, or one host per line | Replaces the domain list. `{"domains":[]}` handles every host. `{"enabled":false}` keeps the saved hosts and handles every host. The response is a `status` snapshot without extraction values. |

Unknown commands return HTTP 400, and command exceptions return HTTP 500. Some invalid bodies return HTTP 200 with `{ "ok": false, "error": "..." }`, so check `ok` as well as the HTTP status. Responses use `Content-Type: application/json` and `X-ATOR: 1`.

`status` fields:

- `extension`, `version` (`2.5.2`), `sessionHandlingAction` (`ATOR`)
- `preview`, `inScopeOnly`, `domainsEnabled`, `domains` (the host list), `trigger` (the condition expression from Preview)
- `tools`: Repeater, Intruder, Scanner, Sequencer, Proxy, Extensions, Burp AI, each with `enabled`
- `extractions`: `name` and `present`; token values and lengths are withheld
- `obtainSteps`, `replacements`, `errorConditions`
- `commandHeader`, `commands`

Example status call. ATOR answers it inside the extension, though Burp MCP can still check its target host permission first:

```http
GET /ator HTTP/1.1
Host: ator.local
X-ATOR-Command: status

```

Example import. The body is the export document, not a wrapper:

```http
POST /ator HTTP/1.1
Host: ator.local
X-ATOR-Command: import
Content-Type: application/json

{"errorCondition":{},"obtainToken":{},"errorConditionReplacement":{}}
```

Example domain list. An empty `domains` array handles every host again:

```http
POST /ator HTTP/1.1
Host: ator.local
X-ATOR-Command: domains
Content-Type: application/json

{"domains":["api.example.com","*.lab.local"]}
```

**Extensions (burp-mcp)** must stay enabled for `send_http1_request` and `send_http2_request` to receive token replacement. The command header itself is accepted from Extensions even when you only want `status` or `export`.

To have session rules call ATOR, add a session handling rule whose action is `ATOR`. burp-mcp `set_project_options` can write that rule. The action obtains missing tokens and applies replacement rules. It does not perform the error-triggered retry.

## Build

Requirements:

- JDK 17 (the compiler `release` is 17)
- Maven
- Burp Suite 2026.8. The Montoya API `2026.7` and legacy Burp Extender API `2.3` are compile dependencies with `provided` scope, so they are not packed into the jar.

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Load `.localdev/target/ATOR-v2.5.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in **Extensions > Add > Java** after building. Maven keeps compiled classes and JARs in the ignored `.localdev/target/` folder. `BappManifest.bmf` names the extension **Authentication Token Obtain and Replace**, screen version `2.5.2`, and points to that generated JAR.

`mvn clean package` is also the manifest `BuildCommand`.

### GitHub Releases

Pushing a version tag runs [the release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml). GitHub checks out that tag, compiles with Java 17 into `.localdev/target/`, and publishes `ATOR-<tag>.jar` plus its SHA-256 file in the repository's Releases section. The workflow checks that the tag matches the version in `pom.xml` by requiring the corresponding Maven artifact name; a mismatch stops the release. The older v2.5 release does not include token-free status responses.

For the next version, update the version in the POM, source, and manifest, merge the release source, then tag that commit and push the tag. For example, for v2.6:

```bash
git tag v2.6
git push origin v2.6
```

The GitHub Release JAR is compiled from tagged source. Compiled JARs stay out of Git.

## Configure ATOR

The suite tab is **ATOR v2.5.2**. It has three sections: **ATOR Configuration**, **Settings**, and **Activity**.

Configuration has four steps:

1. **Error Condition.** The response that means the token is dead.
2. **Obtain Token.** The macro that logs in and extracts values.
3. **Error Condition Replacement.** Where those values are written on the next request.
4. **Preview.** Dry-run the replacement. While Preview is enabled, live traffic is not modified.

Add messages from Proxy history with **Send to ATOR**, then choose **1. Error Condition**, **2. ATOR Macro (Obtain Token)**, or **3. Add domain**.

### Error condition

Each condition has a name, a kind, and a value. The kinds are **Status Code** (exact match, for example `401`), **Body** (the body contains the text), and **Header** (the header block contains the text).

On the replacement step, pick one named condition, or combine several with **AND** or **OR**. Preview shows the expression, for example `Expired AND Unauthorized`. The live handler splits that text on spaces, evaluates each name, and applies the operators left to right. A blank expression does not match.

### Replacement

Name the extraction (for example `token`). The replacement rule uses the same region and writes the extraction value back.

For a Bearer header:

- Match: `Authorization: Bearer \w*`
- Replacement area: `Authorization: Bearer token`

One error condition can have several replacement rules. JSON and `multipart/form-data` bodies use the JSON body extractor. Other bodies and headers use the spot extractor. URL rules read the request line.

Extraction names can request URL encode or decode. A name that starts with `jwt`, such as `jwt_sub`, extracts the token and then reads that claim from the payload.

### Settings

- Tool checkboxes choose which Burp tools the live handler updates. **All/None** toggles every checkbox, including **InScope**.
- **InScope** limits replacement and refresh to in-scope requests.
- **Domains** limits replacement and refresh to the hosts you add. With the list empty, or with **Only selected domains** unchecked, ATOR handles every host.
- **Repeater labels** limits Repeater replacement and refresh to requests carrying a matching `X-ATOR-Repeater-Tab` value. An empty regex disables this limit.
- **Export ATOR** and **Import ATOR** read and write the same JSON that the `export` and `import` commands use, including the domain list.

## Walkthrough with Tiredful

Record traffic from [Tiredful-API](https://github.com/payatu/Tiredful-API) through Burp, then confirm ATOR replaces the token.

1. Generate a token at `http://<HOST:PORT>/handle-user-token/`.
2. Call `http://<HOST:PORT>/api/v1/exams/MQ==/` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
3. Load the ATOR jar.
4. Send `/handle-user-token/` to **ATOR Macro (Obtain Token)**. Select the `access_token` value and name the extraction `token`. This app needs one request. A macro can contain more than one.
5. On the replacement step set:
   - Error condition: status code `401`
   - Pattern: `Authorization: Bearer \w*`
   - Replacement area: `Authorization: Bearer token`
6. Send the exams request from Repeater with a bad bearer token.
   - The response is 401, so ATOR runs the macro, extracts `access_token`, and retries.
   - Repeater shows `200`. The note on the response is `ATOR refreshed this response`.
7. Send it again. The stored token is still valid, so ATOR does not run the macro.

Watch the obtain and retry traffic in Logger++ or the extension output. A second in-flight refresh waits on the obtain lock instead of logging in twice.
